Project: Coaching Management System In PHP With Source Code

# The Coaching Management System In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project contains 7 modules:

Super Admin (Admin of main/Head center)
Admin (Each Center has its own “Center Admin”)
HOD (Each Center has subject wise HOD’s)
Mentor (Each Batch in each center has their own mentors)
Teacher (Each center has their own teachers and their accounts)
Student (Each student of each center has different accounts)
Parents (Each Parent have a different account)
The super admin manages admin and centers, can view teachers, students, and batches. Likewise, the admin manages the students’ records, teachers records, add batches and timetable, assign teacher or mentors to different batches and so on.

The Head of Department(HOD) can look for teachers records along with managing the students’ records. While, the mentors and teachers can only manage the students’ records like their marks, attendance, and so on. And the students and their parents can log in to look for their attendance, timetable, marks, and fees. This project is a simple project specially designed for coaching institutes to keep the records of teachers and students activities in a proper way.
